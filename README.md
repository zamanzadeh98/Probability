Still Incomplete


The concept of expressing and measuring our knowledge and uncertainty using probability is fascinating.

Within this repository, my goal is to elucidate and implement various topics and algorithms related to probability. The following is a comprehensive list of all the algorithms that are both explained and coded:

**Random Variable (RV)**:
- binomial RV
- Poisson RV
- Exponential RV
- Normal RV
